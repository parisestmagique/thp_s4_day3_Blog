# My first blog with Rails

## Prerequisites

Ruby version : 2.5.1

Run ```bundle install``` after cloning it in your local machine

Run ```rails db:migrate``` to get all necessary updates

Run ```rails db:seeds``` to get default database

### General Informations

Check the db/migrate folder to understand all updates that have been done

You may also check the ```schema.rb``` file in the db directory as well as ```seeds.rb```

Models are in the ```app/models``` directory

Note: my data is messy and makes no sense, but I have data, which is the only thing that matters for now

Please take it easy when correcting ;)
